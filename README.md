Usage

Adding Animations

Animations are implemented using Framer Motion. You can customize animations by modifying the properties in the components. For example:

import { motion } from 'framer-motion';

<motion.div
  initial={{ opacity: 0, y: -50 }}
  animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.5 }}
>
  Your Content Here
</motion.div>

Smooth Scrolling

React Scroll is used for smooth scrolling between sections. Example usage:

import { Link } from 'react-scroll';

<Link to="section-id" smooth={true} duration={500}>
  Go to Section
</Link>

Tailwind CSS

Style components using Tailwind's utility classes. For example:

<div className="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 rounded-lg">
  Hello, Tailwind CSS!
</div>

Deployment

To build the project for production:

npm run build

The production-ready files will be in the dist folder. You can deploy these files to any static hosting service like Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.
